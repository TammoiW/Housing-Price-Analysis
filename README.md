# Housing Price Analysis – Paris Real Estate

This project was developed as part of an MSc in Data Science assignment for the **Programming for Data Analytics** module. It focuses on analyzing and modeling the relationship between housing prices and property characteristics using Python.

## 🏠 Overview

The aim of this project is to explore housing market trends in Paris using a dataset that includes features such as square footage and grade. The project uses data visualization and regression modeling to understand and predict property prices.

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Clean and prepare real estate data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python
- Build linear regression models to assess variable influence on price
- Evaluate model performance using R-squared
- Present insights through data visualization and interpretation

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy,Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, R² Score)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Preprocessing, Feature Selection, and Model Evaluation


## 📈 Sample Insights
- A strong positive correlation was found between **property grade** and **price**
- Regression model revealed that for every 1 unit increase in grade, price increased by approx. €208,280
- Model performance: **R² = 0.44** — 44% of price variability explained by grade alone
